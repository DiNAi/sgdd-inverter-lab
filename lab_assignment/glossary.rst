    Apparent power
        product of the rms voltage and the rms current, expressed in volt-amperes (VA).
        Often denoted `S`. Computation: S = V.I
    
    Inverter
        a specific, but very common, type of power electronics converter that can transfer energy
        from a :abbr:`DC (direct current, i.e. unidirectional)` source
        to an :abbr:`AC (alternating current, often sinusoidal)` source.
        
        Most inverter topologies allow the power flow to be reversed (energy transfer
        from the AC side to the DC side).
        When this is the usual operating point of the converter, the inverter
        is often called an active rectifier.
